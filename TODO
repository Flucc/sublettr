    Database setup: Set up your database schema in Supabase for storing your data, such as user information, listings, messages, and bookmarks.

    API endpoints: Create API endpoints for your app using Supabase to interact with your database. You'll need endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, depending on your application's requirements.

    Integrate frontend with backend: Connect your frontend components to the backend API endpoints, fetching and displaying data as needed. Handle user input and form submissions for creating and updating data.

    State management: Implement state management using Svelte stores, especially for sharing data between components and handling global application state.

    Responsive design: Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and responsive by testing it on various devices and screen sizes. Adjust the layout and styles as needed.

    Optimize performance: Optimize your website for performance, such as lazy loading images and components, minimizing CSS and JavaScript, and optimizing API calls.

    Testing: Write unit and integration tests for your components, services, and utilities to ensure that your application works as expected.

    Accessibility: Ensure your website follows best practices for accessibility, such as proper use of ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.

    Deployment: Deploy your website to a hosting provider, configure a custom domain, and set up SSL for secure connections.
